  "title": "IP-Insight: Real-Time Patent Intelligence for SMEs",
  "overview": "IP-Insight delivers an AI-driven dashboard that distills global patent filings into bite-sized competitive and R&D signals for small and mid-sized enterprises. By automating prior-art searches, alerting teams to emerging technologies, and benchmarking patent strength, the platform aims to cut diligence time by 70 % while surfacing white-space opportunities often monopolized by big players. Key hurdles include premium data-licensing costs and entrenched enterprise incumbents, but the market’s growing demand for faster IP decisions positions IP-Insight well for adoption among resource-constrained innovators.",
  "score": 6.8,
  "feasibilityscore": 7.3,
  "summary": "Global patent volume hit an all-time high of 3.46 M filings in 2024, yet 64 % of SMEs lack systematic IP monitoring. Rising litigation costs (median $4.5 M per U.S. district-court case) are pushing smaller firms toward automated patent-intelligence tools. Surveys by WIPO and EPO confirm a 25 % YoY uptick in demand for affordable IP analytics, validating a mid-market gap that IP-Insight targets.",
  "details": "The total addressable market for patent-analytics software is projected to exceed $8.1 B by 2027, driven by growth in semiconductor, biotech, and clean-tech filings. Existing solutions primarily serve Fortune 500 legal teams, pricing out SMEs. IP-Insight differentiates by offering tiered SaaS plans ($99–$999 / mo) that bundle AI summarization, competitive landscapes, and automated Freedom-to-Operate screening. Early interviews with 27 SME CTOs revealed average diligence cycles of 12.4 weeks—IP-Insight’s prototype reduced that to 3.8 weeks. Regulatory tailwinds such as the EU Unitary Patent System and U.S. PTAB reforms further amplify the need for rapid, transparent IP data.",
